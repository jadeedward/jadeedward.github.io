Hi, I'm Jade Edward, I work as a Squad Lead and Senior Back End Engineer at FoodByUs.

Long time meetup attendee, first time speaker.

Many thanks for Max Snow and the sponsors here at Cover Genius for making this a great space to try out my slidedeck!

class: inverse center middle

Every team has at least one go-to person that gets others out of sticky situations!

Are they being recognised for their contributions to building a cohesive team?

Or are they getting bogged down in work that isn't part of their job description?

Let's get stuck into the concept of glue work, and how it can help your team bond.

Are you ready for Christmas? Or even for this talk? 

Because this is the PHP/Laravel End of Year Meetup, you're all going to have to suffer through my questionable choice of festive GIFs.

name: Agenda

## Overview

1. What is glue work?
2. Where does it happen and where is it needed?
3. Who should be doing it, and who actually does it?
4. When does it not work?
5. Why should we change how it's handled?
6. How can it be done better?

???
We're going to go through the what, where, who, when, why, and how of Glue Work.

I know it looks like there are lots of slides, but stick with me, it's quick, I promise!

# What is glue work?

> Glue work is the the less glamorous - and often less-promotable - work that needs to happen to make a team successful.

> Managed deliberately, glue work demonstrates and builds strong technical leadership skills.

> Left unconscious, it can be career limiting.

> It can push people into less technical roles and even out of the industry.

><cite> -- Tanya Reilly "Being Glue" 2019</cite>

???
This definition comes from Tanya Reilly's 2019 Talk titled "Being Glue"

So what does glue work look like?

# Where does glue work happen?

<img src="where.gif" />
<!-- https://i.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExbHR1dWI3dnhwYmJoNWl5emtyMWU0M2x4NThwdDRyMTNpcnJ3emJ4byZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/3otPox3PePYUvuYUgw/giphy.gif -->

---
## Where does glue work occur?

--
- Everywhere!

--
- New teams, small teams, startups

???
New teams may not have quite figured out all the gaps yet.
Small teams might not have enough people to cover everything.
Startups might be testing different markets or strategies.

--
- Large siloed organisations

???
Business units might not talk to each other.
There might be administrative or ownership challenges in gaining access or collaborating.

--
- Dysfunctional organisations 

???
People might not be as invested in doing a good or thorough job.
There might be interpersonal conflict, or an every one for themselves attitude.
Low empathy and psychological safety can mean that people are afraid to raise problems or concerns.

--
- When there are no specific roles designed to handle it

???
Missing roles can mean that the work falls to whoever notices or cares enough to get it done.

---
## Where does glue work emerge from?

--
- Company expansion and contraction transitions
  - Hiring, redundancies, restructuring
???
During times when people are coming and going, or the shape of the organisation is changing, 
new gaps in knowledge, communications, and processes can open up.
Perhaps a larger number of people coming through the hiring pipeline than it's had before.

--

- Team evolution
  - Promotions, secondments, taking leave, moving on
???
At a smaller scale, when people change roles or locations within the organisation, are away, or move on to other opportunities,
things they used to take care of may fall by the wayside without appropriate handover.

--

- When pivoting or expanding to new domains, markets, or solutions
???
When an organisation or project is expanding to new markets or problem spaces, 
there are always new things to learn about and new people to work with,
all of which will come with their own flavour of glue work.

---
## Glue work can be a problem when...

--
- It's taken on invisibly

???
- Higher organisational risk, or "bus factor" if knowledge and processes aren't shared

--
- It's unfairly allocated

???
- Sidelined into doing more glue work because they're good at it
- Reduced capacity for taking on more challenging tasks because of glue workload

--
- It's not recognised as useful or valuable work

???
- Negative performance reviews for "not writing enough code", or "not making enough technical contributions"

--

- It gets in the way of other responsibilities
???
- Interruptions and task switching prevent deep work and flow states
- Workload management is harder, as capacity, momentum, and reliability can be affected

--

- It negatively impacts glue workers and their career goals

???
- Poor work-life balance, burnout
- Overlooked or denied opportunities for career advancement _(especially when those they've helped get the recognition or promotions instead)_
- Prevents learning or practicing the skills needed for their main role

---
name: Why

## Glue work helps teams stick together when...

--
- It is recognised as valuable 

--
- It is shared appropriately among the team

--
- It is used as opportunity for growth and improvement

--
- Glue workers are given support, resources, and recognition

--
- It shines a light on when and where new roles might be needed

???
Recruiting externally for new hires.

Getting someone experienced in project management or tech leadership can bring experience and expertise to that type of work and more.

Offering internal career pivots, secondments, promotions, or training.

_Only if the glue workers want to take their career in that direction_.

Don't push people where they don't want to go, or where it would be limiting for their career.

Non-Managers: keep a work diary for a sprint or a month.

I prefer using my personal Confluence space as a digital one, but pen and paper might work better with your brain.

Check out Bullet Journalling as a useful technique to structure your notes.

consider how work outside that should be handled

and review your workflow management tools and practices to support this

Glue Workers: After you've been documenting for a while, analyse your data, and look for the patterns where you get side tracked.

Glue workers: Resist the temptation to keep volunteering.

Leave space for others to put their hand up first.

If you're excited about something, go for it!

If you already have a process for something, offer to pair/teach someone else how to do it.
*** 
Managers: Try to shake things up from the previous status quo and give people things outside their comfort zone and experience.

You may need to have a period of time where you only allocate glue work, and don't ask for volunteers.

Remember to balance glue work with other work, and don't overload anyone with more than is reasonable.
***
Teflon Techs: Lean into the novelty of something different, and bring your beginners mind.

Use glue work as a palate cleanser between other tasks or meetings if it's easy or quick.

Have pride in all your work - bring the same excellence to glue work that you do to bigger or more complex tasks.
